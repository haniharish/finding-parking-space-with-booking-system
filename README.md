# finding-parking-space-with-booking-system

This project is a **prototype** for an **online parking space finder and booking system**. It allows users to find nearby available parking spots and make simple bookings. The system is designed to enhance parking efficiency in crowded areas, but it's currently in the prototype phase and not a complete application.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is not a full-featured product. It's a static + server-side demo of the intended functionality.
